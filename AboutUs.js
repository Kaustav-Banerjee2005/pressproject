        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          The Press Project’ – ‘Upholding Truth, One Story at a Time’ – is an undergraduate initiative by the students pursuing their BA in Journalism and English (BA - JE). TPP was conceived to catapult the student community from mere observers to participants in community discourses by delivering insightful reportage of real-world issues that are not just in our immediate neighbourhood but from across the globe.<br /><br />
          At The Press Project (TPP), we aspire to be more than just a news publication; we are a platform for the underrepresented voices and concerns that ought to be heard and written about. As student journalists, we believe that the art of journalism, just like our elementary science, can be learnt by doing. Hence, TPP has also been evolving with our learnings as we find more interactive ways to keep our work relevant and important at a time when media consumption and production patterns are shifting rapidly.<br /><br />
          During such times when breaking news and updates-at-the-fingertips are trending among 21st-century readers, we swear by slow and in-depth reporting of issues having a longer shelf life than the trending video of the bride who rode a bullet bike to her wedding.<br /><br />
          Commitment to journalistic integrity and excellence drives us, as we strive to provide accurate, balanced, and thought-provoking reporting on wide-ranging topics.<br /><br />
          Whether you're a reader, a writer, or someone in between, The Press Project invites you to join us on this journey where we aspire to uphold truth, one story at a time.
